# Hello-World
My first repository

I am a student at north seattle community college. My coding background is based in some introduction to C, C++, C# in the context of game design. I also formally studied python, currently java, and I'm learning html5 with sololearn. My interests lie in bionformatics, computational biology, artificial intelligence, game design, sound design, and witchcraft.
